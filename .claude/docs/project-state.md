# Project State

Last updated: 2026-04-29 — initialized by /foundation:urs reconciliation.

**Source of truth split (per ADR 0001):**

- **Requirement intent** lives in `urs/main.md` and `urs/main.tex` (formal, signable).
- **Engineering ledger** lives below — maturity per feature, joined to URS by `urs_ref`.
- **Machine contract** lives in `urs/index.json` — read by every downstream command.

**Maturity legend:** 🔲 Pending → spec → architecture → implementation → tested → reviewed → ✅ shipped.

**Note:** Non-functional, User Role, and Validation requirements (NFR-/UR-/VR-) are
cross-cutting concerns. They are not standalone backlog rows; they constrain
how each FR row is implemented and tested. Examples:

- `NFR-01` (NIK encryption) — applied during `/architecture:new-feature` for FR-01.
- `UR-02` (Dealer regional scope) — enforced in RLS for FR-04, FR-05, FR-06.
- `VR-01` (Every decision logged) — required by `/qa:new-tests` for FR-05, FR-06.

`/foundation:urs` flags any FR backlog row whose tests or migrations don't
reference the relevant NFR/UR/VR via `@urs:` tags during release gating.

## Schema Snapshot

**Tables:**

- `public.registrations` (FR-01) — encrypted NIK/KK, state machine pending → approved | rejected, RLS for Customer/Dealer/Admin scopes.

**Schemas:**

- `private` — encryption helpers `encrypt_pii(text) → bytea`, `decrypt_pii(bytea) → text` (SECURITY DEFINER, locked to RPCs).

**RPCs:**

- `public.submit_registration(p_nik, p_kk, p_selfie_url, p_phone) returns uuid` (FR-01) — validates format, encrypts PII, derives region, inserts pending row.

**Key relationships:**

- `registrations.customer_id → profiles.id`
- `registrations.region_code` derived from `profiles.region_code` at submit time (immutable).

---

## Established Patterns

(Empty — first feature establishes the pattern for the rest.)

---

## Architecture Notes

- **Encryption:** NIK and KK columns require AES-256 with a deterministic
  scheme so exact-match search works (NFR-01). Plan to use Supabase Vault or
  a `pgcrypto` extension with a deterministic IV strategy.
- **Audit table:** single `registration_audit` table, append-only via revoked
  UPDATE/DELETE permissions and an INSERT-only RLS policy. References each
  registration by ID.
- **Region scoping:** each user has `region_code` in profile metadata. Dealer
  RLS policy filters `registration.region_code = (select region_code from profiles where id = auth.uid())`.
- **State machine:** registration.status ∈ {pending, approved, rejected}. State
  transitions are one-way (pending → approved | rejected), enforced by RPC
  `decide_registration` rather than direct UPDATE.
