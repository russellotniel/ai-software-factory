# XLSmart Coaching Session — Working Plan

**This file is the resume document for the work on the `xlsmart-coaching` branch.**
After any `/clear`, read this file first to recover full state, then continue.

---

## Mission

Coaching session for one Telco (XLSmart) viewer, 15–20 min, mixed
presentation/workshop/demo. Goal: showcase the AI Software Factory and ideally
get adoption.

The viewer asked whether the factory covers end-to-end AI-assisted SDLC:
**BRD → test cases → code scaffolding → post-deploy monitoring.**

Our answer:
- BRD piece → reframed as **URS** (User Requirement Specification — what their
  template actually is, regulated-industry style with C/I/D rank).
- Test cases + code scaffolding → already covered by existing factory commands.
- Post-deploy monitoring → out of scope to *replace* Datadog/Prometheus, but in
  scope to *generate the monitoring contract* (instrumentation, SLOs, dashboards,
  alerts) from the spec. Sketch as roadmap, not built for this session.

## Deadlines

- **Soft target:** tonight (2026-04-29) by 23:00 — end of work session.
- **Hard deadline:** 2026-04-30 at 16:00 — coaching session begins.

## Branch

`xlsmart-coaching` — branched from `main`. Work directly here. Commit
incrementally with focused messages, sign with Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7.

## Demo project

**SIM Registration Portal.** Indonesian PP / Kominfo regulation requires every
prepaid SIM to register with NIK + KK. Universally recognizable for a telco
audience. Has natural compliance + audit + multi-role + approval-workflow
features → exercises every governance feature the factory has.

Stack: Next.js 16 + Supabase (factory default).

## Demo concept

Two bands of demo content:

1. **Pre-baked band** — URS authored, 3 features shipped through full pipeline
   (FR-01 submit registration, FR-03 dealer approval, VR-01 audit log). Walk
   through artifacts. Ends with `grep FR-XX` traceability moment as the climax.
2. **Live band** — one small feature run end-to-end during the session. Decided
   in Phase 6.

Wow moment: `grep -r "FR-03" .` shows the URS ID threaded through URS doc, spec,
migration, code, test, release gate output. Auto-generated traceability matrix.

## Architecture (already decided — don't re-litigate)

See ADR 0001 and ADR 0002 in `.claude/docs/adr/`.

Key facts to remember:

- URS source is `urs/main.md` (Markdown, structured, factory-editable).
- Compiled to `urs/main.tex` (formal, signed, legal artifact) using
  `latex_template/main.tex` as layout.
- `urs/index.json` is the downstream contract — every command after URS reads
  this, never the LaTeX or Markdown directly.
- `project-state.md` is the engineering ledger; it links to URS IDs but does
  NOT store requirement text. Joined by URS ID.
- C/I/D rank → Risk Zone 1/2/3 mapping is automatic, applied to
  `project-config.json#riskZones` by `/foundation:urs`.
- URS IDs: `FR-`, `NFR-`, `UR-`, `VR-` prefixes, unique across doc.
- Bold title in Requirement cell (`**Submit registration**: ...`) becomes the
  short label in `index.json`.
- Sign-off + status in YAML front-matter; status moves `draft → reviewed → signed`.

## Build vs pre-bake vs roadmap split (already decided)

**Build:**

1. ADR 0001 + 0002 ✅ done
2. `/foundation:urs:draft` — brief → `urs/main.md` skeleton with FR/NFR/UR/VR.
3. `/foundation:urs` — compile/lock: `main.md` → `main.tex` + `index.json`,
   reconcile `project-state.md`, map C/I/D → Risk Zone in `project-config.json`.
4. Tiny extension to `/foundation:shape-spec` to accept `--from-urs FR-XX` flag.

**Pre-bake (using existing factory commands, find friction along the way):**

- 1-page brief for SIM Registration Portal.
- Run `urs:draft` → real `urs/main.md`.
- Hand-edit a few rows (visible in git history — the SA review moment).
- Run `/foundation:urs` → `main.tex` + `index.json` + project-state seeded + risk
  zones mapped.
- Run `/foundation:shape-spec --from-urs FR-01`, `FR-03`, `VR-01` → specs.
- Run `/architecture:new-feature` for each → migrations + RPC + API contracts.
- Run `/implementation:new-feature` for each → Server Actions + Zod + components.
- Run `/qa:new-tests` for each → test scaffolds.
- Run `/deployment:release` dry-run → see gates including new C-rank coverage.

**Roadmap (do NOT build, sketch in talk):**

- Extending `discover`/`plan`/`shape-spec` to write to URS source (full
  co-production architecture). Multi-day refactor with risk.
- `/observability:setup` — generate OTel + SLO + dashboard + alerts from spec.
- `/observability:incident-to-spec` — close the post-deploy feedback loop.

## URS contents (sketched, finalize during draft)

```
FR-01 (C)  Customer can submit SIM registration with NIK + KK + selfie
FR-02 (C)  System validates NIK format (16 digits, Dukcapil schema)
FR-03 (C)  Dealer can approve or reject pending registrations in their region
FR-04 (C)  On approve, SIM is activated and audit log entry is written
FR-05 (I)  Admin can view all registrations across regions
FR-06 (D)  Admin can export registration report as CSV

NFR-01 (C) NIK encrypted at rest (AES-256)
NFR-02 (I) Approval action completes within 2s p95
NFR-03 (I) Audit log is append-only, never deleted

UR-01      Customer: submit own, view own status
UR-02      Dealer: approve/reject within assigned region
UR-03      Admin: view all, run reports
UR-04      Auditor: read-only access to audit log

VR-01 (C)  Every approval/rejection writes audit log entry with actor + timestamp
VR-02 (C)  NIK changes after approval require dual approval
VR-03 (I)  Rejected registrations must include a reason
```

Result: 3 C-rank → Zone 1, 4 I-rank → Zone 2, 1 D-rank → Zone 3.

## Phases — status and check-in points

After each phase: commit, update this file's "Current state" section, mark task
completed, **check in with the user**. User wants check-ins at phase boundaries.

### Phase 1 — Architecture ✅ DONE

Output:
- `.claude/docs/adr/0001-urs-project-state-separation.md`
- `.claude/docs/adr/0002-urs-source-format.md`

Commit: `b8c805a docs: ADR 0001 + 0002 for URS architecture`

### Phase 2 — Build `/foundation:urs:draft`

Goal: command that takes a 1-page product brief and emits `urs/main.md`
skeleton with FR/NFR/UR/VR rows + ranks + user matrix + glossary.

Inputs: path to brief markdown file (or interactive Q&A).

Behavior:
1. Read brief or run interactive discover-style Q&A to gather: product name,
   target users + roles, modules/features, regulatory drivers, key constraints.
2. Produce a draft `urs/main.md` with:
   - YAML front-matter (project name, code, version=0.1, status=draft).
   - Project Detail narrative (4 subsections from brief).
   - User Matrix (modules × roles).
   - Functional / Non-functional / User Role / Validation tables (proposed reqs
     with proposed C/I/D rank — SA reviews and adjusts).
   - Glossary (acronyms detected from brief).
3. Print summary of what was generated, ask SA to review the .md before running
   `/foundation:urs`.

Done when: command file `.claude/commands/foundation/urs-draft.md` exists,
follows existing command file format, has clear preconditions/steps/outputs/
COMMAND_COMPLETE block.

Reference command files for style: `.claude/commands/foundation/plan.md`,
`.claude/commands/foundation/discover.md`, `.claude/commands/foundation/shape-spec.md`.

Commit message style: `feat(foundation): add /foundation:urs:draft command for AI-assisted URS authoring`.

### Phase 3 — Build `/foundation:urs`

Goal: compile/lock command that turns `urs/main.md` into the formal artifact
set and seeds project-state.

Inputs: presence of `urs/main.md`.

Behavior:
1. Parse `urs/main.md` (YAML front-matter + Markdown tables).
2. Validate invariants from ADR 0002 (column count, unique IDs, rank values).
3. Compile to `urs/main.tex` using `latex_template/main.tex` as layout.
   Substitution by section heading.
4. Emit `urs/index.json` per ADR 0002 schema, with `risk_zone` derived from rank.
5. Reconcile with `.claude/docs/project-state.md`:
   - For each URS req, ensure a backlog row exists with `urs_ref`, `risk_zone`,
     and `maturity` (default `🔲 Pending`).
   - Flag URS reqs without backlog rows; flag backlog rows with broken
     `urs_ref` links.
6. Update `.claude/project-config.json#riskZones` if the file exists, mapping
   C/I/D to Zone 1/2/3 with the URS IDs in each zone.
7. Print summary: req counts by class and rank, zone distribution, drift report,
   files written.

Done when: command file `.claude/commands/foundation/urs.md` exists, follows
existing format, has clear preconditions/steps/outputs/COMMAND_COMPLETE block.

Commit message style: `feat(foundation): add /foundation:urs compile/reconcile command`.

### Phase 4 — Wire `--from-urs` into `shape-spec`

Goal: small extension to `/foundation:shape-spec` so `--from-urs FR-03` reads
the URS row from `urs/index.json` and pre-fills the spec scaffold.

Behavior:
1. Add a "Step 0 — Optional URS Lookup" section to `shape-spec.md` that, if
   the user invokes with `--from-urs FR-XX`, reads `urs/index.json`, finds the
   matching req, and uses `title`, `text`, `rank`, and `risk_zone` to seed the
   spec.
2. Stamp `@urs: FR-XX` into the spec front-matter alongside `@spec`.

Done when: `shape-spec.md` modified, `@urs:` stamping conventions added.

Commit message style: `feat(foundation): shape-spec --from-urs flag for URS-driven spec seeding`.

### Phase 5 — Pre-bake SIM Registration Portal demo

Goal: actually run the pipeline on the demo project. Find friction. Fix. Have
artifacts ready for the coaching session.

Steps:
1. Write 1-page brief at `urs/brief.md`.
2. Run `/foundation:urs:draft` → produce `urs/main.md`. (If `/foundation:init`
   has not been run on this branch, may need to run that first or write a
   minimal `project-config.json` by hand for the demo project.)
3. Review and edit `urs/main.md` to match the URS contents block above. Commit
   the edits separately ("SA review" moment for the demo).
4. Run `/foundation:urs` → verify `main.tex`, `index.json`, project-state
   seeded, risk zones mapped.
5. For FR-01, FR-03, VR-01:
   - `/foundation:shape-spec --from-urs FR-XX` → spec.
   - `/architecture:new-feature` → migration + RPC + API contract.
   - `/implementation:new-feature` → Server Action + Zod + component.
   - `/qa:new-tests` → tests.
6. `/deployment:release` dry-run → gate output, including C-rank URS coverage.
7. Verify the `grep -r "FR-03" .` traceability moment works as expected.
   May need to ensure `@urs:` tags are stamped consistently.

Done when: artifacts exist, traceability grep works, demo can be walked
through end-to-end.

Commit cadence: one commit per major step (URS, each feature, release dry-run).

### Phase 6 — Live feature + dry-run

Goal: pick the live demo feature, prepare prompts, do an end-to-end timed
dry-run.

Candidates for live:
- Customer views own registration status (safer — read-only with RLS).
- FR-06 Admin CSV export (more wow but riskier).

Decide with user. Prepare the exact prompts in scrollback. Time the dry-run.
Adjust the demo feature scope if it runs over.

Done when: live feature plan exists, prompts ready, demo timed under 15 min.

## Current state

| Phase | Status | Last commit |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Architecture (ADRs) | ✅ done | b8c805a |
| 2. /foundation:urs:draft | ✅ done | 2bc1ce0 |
| 3. /foundation:urs | ✅ done | bde797d |
| 4. shape-spec --from-urs + @urs propagation | ✅ done | 43f08fd, a2027e0 |
| 5. Pre-bake demo | 🟡 next | — |
| 6. Live feature + dry-run | ⏳ pending | — |

**Note discovered in Phase 3:** `project-config.json#riskZones` already exists
but is **path-based** (file globs), not requirement-based. Different concept.
Decision: do NOT touch the path-based key. URS-driven zone is per-requirement,
stored in `urs/index.json` and per-feature in `project-state.md`. The two
concepts coexist.

**Note for Phase 5 pre-bake:** existing `project-state.md` schema (from
plan.md / shape-spec.md / new-feature.md) uses columns `# | Feature | Status |
Depends On | Spec` plus `Stage` and a `Feature Timeline`. URS reconciliation
adds `urs_ref` and `risk_zone` columns. Watch for friction during pre-bake —
may need to reconcile schemas or simplify.

**Phase 4 actually completed in two commits:**
- `43f08fd` — shape-spec --from-urs flag + spec template YAML front-matter
- `a2027e0` — @urs propagation across architecture/implementation/qa commands;
  qa risk_zone now prefers URS-derived value from spec front-matter

**Next action:** Start Phase 5 (pre-bake the SIM Registration Portal demo).

Pre-bake plan:
1. Decide where the demo project files live in this repo (since we're working
   directly in the factory, not creating a separate project). Likely `urs/` for
   the URS artifacts at repo root, and skip the actual Next.js app — the wow
   moment is the `grep` traceability across SPECS and command outputs, which we
   can demonstrate without a runnable app.
2. Write a 1-page brief at `urs/brief.md` describing SIM Registration Portal.
3. Either run /foundation:urs:draft against it OR hand-author urs/main.md
   directly using the brief + the URS contents block in this plan.
4. Run /foundation:urs to compile main.tex + index.json + reconcile project-state.
5. Run /foundation:shape-spec --from-urs FR-01, FR-03, VR-01 — produce specs.
6. Run /architecture:new-feature for each — produce migrations + RPCs.
7. Run /implementation:new-feature for each — produce schemas/actions/components.
   (May or may not actually write to src/features/ — depends on whether we want
   a runnable app. Decision: write to `demo/sim-registration/src/features/` so
   we have artifacts to grep without polluting the factory's own src/.)
8. Run /qa:new-tests — produce tests.
9. Run /deployment:release dry-run — produce gate output.
10. Test the grep moment: grep -r "FR-03" .

**Important friction note:** the factory's existing project-state.md schema
(plan.md / shape-spec.md / new-feature.md) doesn't have urs_ref or risk_zone
columns. /foundation:urs is supposed to add them when reconciling. During
pre-bake, watch for whether this works cleanly or needs a smaller fix.

**Decision for pre-bake:** since this repo has no `.claude/docs/project-state.md`
yet (it's the factory itself, not a project), the demo will create it from
scratch via /foundation:urs reconciliation. That actually exercises the
"create from scratch" code path.

## Open questions

- Live feature decision (Phase 6).
- Whether the demo needs an actual runnable Next.js project or just artifacts
  is sufficient. Lean toward artifacts-only for time.
- Whether to also run `/foundation:init` on this branch (might be needed before
  `/foundation:urs` works because reconciliation reads `project-config.json`).
  Decision: try without; add only if needed.

## Existing factory structure (quick map)

- `.claude/commands/foundation/` — command files (init, discover, plan, shape-spec, status, validate, inject-standards)
- `.claude/commands/architecture-os/` — new-feature, review
- `.claude/commands/implementation-os/` — new-feature, review
- `.claude/commands/qa-os/` — new-tests, fix
- `.claude/commands/deployment-os/` — k8s-config, release
- `.claude/commands/design-os/` — import, system
- `.claude/docs/standards-index.yml` — keyword → standards file mapping
- `.claude/docs/foundation/` — product-mission, principles, tech-standards, auth-model, mcp-setup, compliance-standards
- `.claude/docs/architecture-os/` — schema-conventions, rpc-standards, api-contracts, audit-trail, system-design
- `.claude/docs/implementation-os/standards.md`
- `.claude/docs/data-fetching-os/` — caching-strategy, server-vs-client
- `.claude/docs/qa-os/strategy.md`
- `.claude/docs/deployment-os/` — ci-cd, environments, release-process, k8s-sizing
- `.claude/docs/specs/_template.md`
- `.claude/docs/adr/` — new, 0001 + 0002
- `latex_template/main.tex` — formal URS layout (input to compiler)
- `urs/` — does not exist yet, will be created in Phase 5
